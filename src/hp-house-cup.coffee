# Description
#   A little Hubot script for keeping track of House Cup Points
#
# Dependencies:
#   None
#
# Configuration:
#   None
#
# Commands:
#   hubot give +<x> points to <house> - add x points to house
#   hubot take -<x> points from house - subtract x points from house
#   hubot hosue cup standings - print current points stored
#
# Examples:
#   hubot give 20 points to Ravenclaw
#   hubot -20 points Slytherin
#   hubot 10 points to Gryffindor
#
# Notes:
#   Inspired by the House Cup held at Some Office in Chicago, a cool space
#   full of cool people. Check it out: http://instagram.com/p/uzJW85D6yx
#   It is best if people are actually interested in using Harry Potter house
#   points to keep track of random positive / negative actions in the chat,
#   as things can get out of hand pretty quickly unless a relative
#   points scale is established. Having a Headmaster is advised to keep
#   order in Hogwarts! A Muggle house is available to include those who dont
#   understand or cant decide on a house. The Regex errs on the side of
#   complexity to make a bad attempt at capturing any possible phrasing
#   for the command. Please let me know if this ends up interfering with
#   any other script! I really have no clue what I'm doing.
